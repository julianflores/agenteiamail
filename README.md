Push-style email for an AI agent. It finds out about new mail within about a
second, without polling, and can read and send under a recipient allowlist.

Built around [Himalaya](https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya) for a plain
IMAP/SMTP account, running on Ubuntu 24.04 under the OpenClaw, Hermes Agent or
Claude Code harness. OpenClaw on macOS is supported through per-user launchd
LaunchAgents. Hermes operators configure two authenticated routes as described
in [`HERMES.md`](HERMES.md).

Claude Code works differently from the other two and it is worth knowing before
you start: nothing outside a Claude Code session can speak into it, so mail is
not pushed to the agent — the agent comes and gets it. Its session-start hook
replays what arrived while nothing was running and then asks the agent to arm a
watch for what lands next. Nothing can enforce that from outside, so it is the
one step that rests on the agent doing as it is told. See
[`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) §6.

## Setting this up on your agent

Three steps. The first is yours alone, the second is one paste, the third is two
minutes of checking that it really works.

### Step 1: Give it a mailbox

The agent needs an email account of its own and the connection details for it,
written into a `.env` file. **If your agent runs under a harness, that file
belongs in the harness's own workspace folder** — `~/.hermes/workspace/.env`,
`~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`, `~/.claude/workspace/.env` — which is where the
agent is told to look and where this tool reads it from. On a host with no
harness, put it in the clone.

**[MAILBOX_SETUP.md](MAILBOX_SETUP.md) walks through it**: which account to use,
where to find the server hostname (the one part that reliably goes wrong), and the
file itself.

Do this yourself rather than asking the agent to. It needs a password, and a
password should not travel through a chat.

### Step 2: Point the agent at this repository

Paste this to your agent:

```text
Check your email account settings in the workspace folder of your Harness
installation directory.

../workspace/.env

Then install this repository so you can use it:
https://github.com/julianflores/agenteiamail

Follow the AGENTS.md file inside the repository.
Ask me anything you need.
```

<details>
<summary>En español</summary>

```text
Revisa la configuración de tu cuenta de correo en la carpeta workspace del
directorio de instalación de tu Harness.

../workspace/.env

Luego instala este repositorio para poder usarla:
https://github.com/julianflores/agenteiamail

Sigue el archivo AGENTS.md dentro del repositorio.
Pregúntame lo que necesites.
```

</details>

Everything else the agent needs is in the repository, so the prompt only has to
point at it.

Expect questions before it starts. If Step 1 went well there should be few, and if
it asks for the password, refuse: a password pasted into a chat sits in that
transcript permanently, and no later care undoes it. That is not a step in any of
these instructions.

### Step 3: Test it yourself

The agent runs its own checklist and will tell you it passed. Two minutes of your
own testing is worth more, because you are testing the thing you actually care
about: does it notice, and does it stay inside its limits.

**Test 1: send it an email, and put an accent in the subject.**

From your own address, with a subject like `Prueba de correo: ñ, á, ¿qué tal?`
Then ask the agent what just arrived.

Within a couple of seconds it should tell you, and **the subject should come back
readable**. If you see `=?utf-8?q?...` instead, header decoding is broken, which
matters far more than it looks, because if you work in Spanish that is nearly every
message you will ever receive.

The accent is the whole point of this test. A plain English subject passes whether
or not decoding works.

**Test 2: ask it to email a stranger.**

First ask it to send you something, and confirm it arrives. Then ask it to send a
message to an address that is **not** on its approved list.

It should refuse. Not ask permission, not check with you first; refuse, and tell
you the address is not on the list. That allowlist is the entire reason it is safe
to let an agent that reads untrusted email also send it, so it is worth watching it
work once with your own eyes.

If it sends, stop and tell whoever set it up. Something is wrong.

## What your agent will be able to do

- **Know about new mail in about a second**, without polling and without being
  told to check.
- **Read and send** through Himalaya, using the mailbox you configured.
- **Send only to addresses you approved**, listed in `roster.md`. Anything else is
  refused outright rather than asked about.
- **Work from mail sent by those same approved addresses.** You email it a task, it
  does the task and emails you the answer. No acknowledgement first, no permission
  round-trip; you already granted that by putting yourself on the list.
- **Leave everyone else's mail alone.** Mail from an address that is not on the
  list is reported to you and nothing more.

## What it changes on the machine

Worth knowing before you agree to it. The agent is instructed to report all of
this back when it finishes, and you can hold it to the list:

- A supervised user service that runs continuously and restarts on failure:
  systemd user units on Ubuntu, launchd LaunchAgents on macOS
- A credentials file at mode `600` — your harness's workspace `.env` if you keep
  one there, otherwise `.env` inside the clone. It is read where it lies and
  never copied
- Log and state files under `state/` inside the clone
- Lingering enabled for the user on systemd hosts, or per-user LaunchAgents on
  macOS
- A standing rule added to the agent's own instructions

All of it is reversible; [`UNINSTALL.md`](UNINSTALL.md) removes every item on that
list, in an order that does not leave you working from memory.

## Keeping it up to date

The installed version is in [`VERSION`](VERSION), and the agent is told which
one it is running at the start of every session, along with whether anything
newer has been released.

You can ask it the same question directly:

```bash
scripts/version.sh
```

It reads the released version from this repository's tags, so there is no
account and no token involved, and it says so plainly when it could not reach
the network rather than reporting an install as current because nothing
contradicted it.

Upgrading is [`UPGRADE.md`](UPGRADE.md), and what changed between two versions
is [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Read the changelog first: a release
occasionally needs a step beyond `git pull`, and the failure mode of skipping it
is a listener that works until the next reboot.

## Security

The agent works from its mail, so the question is not whether it takes
instructions from email (it does, that is the point) but **whose**.

- `roster.md` is an exact-match allowlist, and it is the entire answer. On the
  list: the agent does what the message asks and replies. Not on the list: the
  agent tells you the mail arrived and does nothing else with it.
- Matching is on `From` only. A `Reply-To` pointing at someone you approved
  confers nothing, so a stranger cannot borrow a listed address with a header.
- **Adding someone to `roster.md` is your decision**, never a response to
  something that arrived in the mail. That line is what turns a sender into
  someone your agent obeys, so it is worth treating as a real one.
- No roster file means nobody is trusted; a fresh install reads mail and acts on
  none of it until you write the list.
- The password lives in a `600` file outside the repository and never passes
  through a chat transcript.

Note what this design leans on: your mail provider. SPF, DKIM and DMARC are
enforced upstream, before anything reaches the inbox, which is what keeps a forged
`From` from being trivial. If you point this at a mailbox with no such filtering,
the roster is weaker than it looks.

## Runtime paths

The clone is the install. Everything it owns lives inside it, so choosing where
to clone is how you choose where to install.

- Repo: anywhere. `~/.openclaw/workspace/agenteiamail` on OpenClaw,
  `~/.hermes/workspace/agenteiamail` on Hermes Agent,
  `~/.claude/workspace/agenteiamail` on Claude Code, if you have no preference;
  every generated path is resolved from where the scripts are, so an existing
  clone needs no move.
- Secret env: `<clone>/.env`: mode `600`, ignored by git, never committed. An
  install that already keeps credentials elsewhere keeps them there.
- Event state: `<clone>/state/`
- Route secrets: `<clone>/hermes/`, mode `600`
- User services: `~/.config/systemd/user/agenteiamail-*.service` on Ubuntu, or
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agenteiamail.*.plist` on macOS

Secrets inside a git working tree are kept out of `git status` by `.gitignore`,
and `scripts/install.sh` refuses to write if any of them is tracked or unignored.
`git clean -xdf` still deletes them all — use `git clean -df` on a live install.

An install made before this layout keeps credentials under
`~/.config/agenteiamail` and state under `~/.local/state/agenteiamail`, entirely
and indefinitely. `scripts/install.sh --migrate` moves it only when asked.

## The property everything serves

**Never silently fail.** Latency was the easy problem; IDLE solved it in an
afternoon. Everything else here exists because the expensive failure is not being
slow, it is **confidently reporting no new mail while blind**.

That is why the last-seen UID is persisted per message, why `UIDVALIDITY` is
checked on every connect, why the error log is watched alongside the event log, and
why the session-start hook asks whether the service is actually running.
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) explains each one and what breaks without it.
