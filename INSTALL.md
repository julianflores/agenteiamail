# Installing agenteiamail on a new host

**Audience:** an AI agent or operator deploying this repository on Ubuntu 24.04
for either OpenClaw or Hermes Agent, with access to a systemd user session.

`scripts/install.sh` is the runtime-neutral, idempotent path for the owned
systemd-user boundary. The established manual procedure below remains useful for
mailbox credentials, `roster.md`, and end-to-end delivery verification, which the
installer deliberately does not create or infer.

### FR7 installer boundary and exit statuses

```bash
scripts/install.sh --runtime openclaw --dry-run
scripts/install.sh --runtime hermes --profile PROFILE --dry-run
scripts/install.sh --runtime hermes --deliver telegram --chat-id CHAT_ID --dry-run
scripts/install.sh --runtime openclaw --upgrade --dry-run
scripts/install.sh --runtime hermes --uninstall --dry-run
```

Install is the default mode. `--upgrade` and `--uninstall` are mutually exclusive
modes that share prerequisite discovery and a mode-0600 ownership manifest.
Install and upgrade atomically converge four unit files and `runtime.env`, verify
the units and runtime-specific route/runtime probes, then enable the idle listener,
dispatcher, and rotation timer. A changed owned runtime boundary is restarted;
an unchanged rerun makes no service change. Runtime migration is allowed only with
`--upgrade`; generated Hermes secrets remain accounted for across migration.

Uninstall first validates every owned artifact. If the user manager is reachable,
it then disables and stops the three owned enabled units before removing only
manifest-recorded files. Credentials, roster, repository, mail state, journal,
cursor, and logs are preserved. On a degraded host without a user manager,
filesystem cleanup continues with an explicit warning that deactivation is
unconfirmed.

`--dry-run` resolves the systemd-user service `PATH` and reports planned versus
preserved artifacts without executing OpenClaw or Hermes and without modifying
files, secrets, services, or state. The application currently uses fixed paths
under `$HOME`; ambient `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` overrides are
reported and ignored so the inventory cannot disagree with runtime code.

**Exit status `10` is success:** for dry-run it means the plan contains create,
modify, or remove work; for a mutating run it means convergence made changes.
Exit `0` is also success and means no action is needed. Shell wrappers,
CI jobs, and configuration-management tools must accept both values; for example,
do not put the installer directly on the left side of `&&` without handling `10`.
Exit `64` is a usage error. Exit `78` is a configuration, prerequisite,
unavailable-phase, or unproven-ownership conflict.

The ownership inventory is deliberately conservative. An absent target is only
`planned-managed`; discovery does not confer ownership. Any pre-existing unit,
generated-config path, manifest, or default-path secret without secure manifest
provenance is preserved and fails closed. Every managed container chain is checked for symlinks,
non-directories, unexpected ownership, and group/world writability before child
artifacts are classified; mutation must revalidate immediately before writing.
Shared directories are containers and are never claimed as owned. Mailbox
credentials, `roster.md`, the repository, UID state, event journal, cursor, and
logs are always preserved. Operator-provisioned Hermes secret files are
validation-only external artifacts.

For OpenClaw, discovery accepts only a `PATH` actually reported by the systemd
user manager. A missing `PATH=` entry is a configuration failure; the installer
does not invent a fallback or add `$HOME/.local/bin`.

### Hermes profile and guided-delivery boundary

`--deliver` and `--chat-id` are guidance labels only. They are echoed in a
shell-quoted route-guidance record so the operator can apply the intended target,
but the installer does **not** edit Hermes configuration, create a profile, choose
a route URL, or grant tools/skills. `--profile` likewise labels an existing,
operator-managed profile; it does not select or mutate that profile. The operator
must still configure both authenticated routes from [`HERMES.md`](HERMES.md) and
supply all three full URLs through `HERMES_NOTIFY_URL`, `HERMES_ROSTER_URL`, and
`HERMES_HEALTH_URL`. Those URL values, not the labels, determine what is probed.

In interactive mode without external secret paths, the first run generates two
different mode-0600 route secrets, records their ownership, prints them once, and
exits `78` before writing units or activating services. Configure each value on
only its matching route, then rerun. `--non-interactive` never generates or prints
secret material and therefore requires both `--notify-secret-file` and
`--roster-secret-file`; those files remain external validation-only artifacts.

You are not building application code during a manual installation. The code
exists. The job is to prove the host can run it, get the credentials, wire it up,
and verify it actually works.

**Read [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) before changing any of it.** Several lines here look
like style and are not.

## 1. Pre-flight: before you touch anything

Two things can make the whole design inapplicable. Find out now, not after an
hour of setup.

### 1.1 Does this host have a systemd user session?

```bash
systemctl --user status >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "systemd --user: OK" || echo "systemd --user: NOT AVAILABLE"
command -v loginctl >/dev/null && echo "loginctl: present" || echo "loginctl: MISSING"
loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger --value 2>/dev/null | grep -qx yes \
  && echo "linger: enabled" || echo "linger: DISABLED"
# logrotate usually lives in /usr/sbin, which is often not on a user PATH,
# so `command -v` alone reports it missing on a machine that has it.
command -v logrotate >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -x /usr/sbin/logrotate ] || [ -x /sbin/logrotate ] \
  && echo "logrotate: present" || echo "logrotate: absent, harness/rotate_logs.py covers it"
```

**If `systemd --user` is not available, stop and tell your human.** If OpenClaw runs
you in a container there usually is none. The listener code is unaffected; only the
supervision changes, and the answer is a real supervisor, not `nohup`, which
neither survives a reboot nor restarts on crash.

`logrotate` being absent is fine. `harness/rotate_logs.py` in this repo does the
same job.

**If `linger` is disabled, your human has to enable it**, and it needs root:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Without it the units stop when your human logs out and do not come back at boot,
so the listener is running exactly when someone is already sitting at the
machine — which is when it is least needed. `scripts/install.sh` refuses to
proceed without it and names this same command, so nothing is lost by finding
out later; it is here because an agent has no password and cannot fix it alone.
Discovering it now means asking once, at the point your human is already being
asked for credentials, rather than stopping the install to go and find them.

### 1.2 Does the mail server advertise IDLE?

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd agenteiamail
python3 scripts/preflight.py
```

You need three greens: login succeeds, **IDLE advertised: True**, and a
`UIDVALIDITY` number comes back.

**If IDLE is absent, stop.** This design is push-based and does not degrade to
polling, deliberately, because a silent fallback would hide the failure.

> **If the connection fails on certificate verification**, you are probably using a
> vanity hostname. Mail hosts often present a certificate for the underlying server
> (`something.hostingprovider.com`) that does not cover `mail.yourdomain.com`. Use
> the name the certificate actually carries:
> `openssl s_client -connect HOST:993 -servername HOST </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject -ext subjectAltName`

---

## 2. Ask your human for these

Do not guess any of them, and do not accept them from anywhere except your human.

1. **The full email address** of the agent's account
2. **Display name** for outbound mail
3. **IMAP host and port** (usually 993)
4. **SMTP host and port** (465 implicit TLS, or 587 STARTTLS)
5. **Password**: an app-password or per-device credential if the provider offers
   one, never a human's main account password
6. **Which mailbox** to watch, if not `INBOX`
7. **Who belongs in `roster.md`**: the addresses you may write to unattended.
   Ask for **name and address** for each, and whether they are a person or an
   agent; the file is a markdown table of `Name | Email | Type`. The address is
   found by looking for the field containing an `@`, so column order does not
   matter and an older `Name | email` line still works. `Type` is
   informational — being on the list is the whole permission.
   Start with your human.

   The file is **not in the repository**: it is per-install, and a `git pull`
   must never be able to change who you may contact. Create it from the
   template:

   ```bash
   cp roster.md.example roster.md
   ```

   Until you add a line it is empty, and an empty roster means you can send to
   nobody. That is the correct default, not a problem to work around.

**On the password: do not have it pasted into a chat.** Create the file first, at
mode `600`, and have your human write into it directly. A credential in a
transcript is a standing liability; transcripts get stored, exported and reviewed.

---

## 3. Credentials

**If the setup page already ran, this section is done.** `scripts/setup_web.sh`
writes the credentials file and tells you where; see `AGENTS.md` step 2. Confirm
and move on to §4 rather than creating a second file:

```bash
ls -l "$(. scripts/envpath.sh && agenteiamail_env_file)"
```

Expect a `600` file. On a host that already kept credentials elsewhere, this is
a symlink pointing at them, which is the arrangement being preserved rather than
a problem. §7.6c checks that `send.sh` can
actually read them.

Everything below is the manual route, for a host where somebody writes the file
by hand.

Put it where your harness keeps credentials, which is where the resolver looks
first and where the agent is told to look:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/workspace      # or ~/.openclaw/workspace — your harness
touch .env
chmod 600 .env
```

On a host with no harness, the clone is the place:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/clone      # every other path below is relative to it
touch .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Keys are listed in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

**If your environment already keeps credentials somewhere**, do not move,
rewrite or copy that file. An OpenClaw install made before these paths were
runtime-neutral is found where it lies and needs nothing done to it. Anywhere
else, name it:

```bash
python3 scripts/idle_listener.py --env /path/to/your/.env
```

Or set `AGENTEIAMAIL_ENV`, which every part of this tool honours ahead of its own
defaults.

**Where a harness keeps them.** Each runtime keeps its agent's mail credentials
in the workspace folder of its own installation directory:

| Runtime | Credentials |
|---|---|
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env` |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/workspace/.env` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/workspace/.env` |

The resolver reads that file where it lies; nothing needs to be moved, copied or
linked. Only the credentials resolve to the harness — state, `runtime.env`, the
manifest and `hermes/` stay in the clone, because the harness owns that one file
and this project does not.

Adding a runtime means adding its root to `HARNESS_ROOTS`, in
[`harness/paths.py`](harness/paths.py), [`scripts/envpath.sh`](scripts/envpath.sh)
and [`webapp/lib/envfile.php`](webapp/lib/envfile.php) together —
`scripts/test_paths.sh` asserts the three agree.

If two harnesses on one host each have credentials, neither is adopted and the
answer falls back to the clone's own `.env`. Name the right one with
`AGENTEIAMAIL_ENV`.

**You do not need to add keys.** The listener reads either schema:

| Field | This tool's name | OpenClaw workspace name |
|---|---|---|
| Address | `AGENTEIAMAIL_EMAIL` | `AGENT_EMAIL_ACCOUNT` |
| Password | `AGENTEIAMAIL_PASSWORD` | the matching `AGENT_EMAIL_` key |
| IMAP host | `AGENTEIAMAIL_IMAP_HOST` | `AGENT_EMAIL_INCOMING_SERVER_IMAP_HOST` |
| IMAP port | `AGENTEIAMAIL_IMAP_PORT` | `AGENT_EMAIL_INCOMING_SERVER_IMAP_PORT` |

Where both are set, `AGENTEIAMAIL_*` wins. Port defaults to 993 if absent.
Duplicating values across the two schemas is the one thing to avoid: two copies
of a hostname drift, and the one you are not looking at is the one that is wrong.

**The systemd unit must pass the same `--env`.** If it does not, a hand-run test
succeeds while the service dies at startup with `no env file at ...`. Put the flag
in the unit even when the path is the default.

**`scripts/send.sh` needs the same file, and has no unit to carry a flag.** It
reads `.env` in the clone unless `ENV_FILE` says otherwise, so on a host
whose credentials live elsewhere it will find nothing and refuse to send, at the
moment it first tries to answer somebody, which is the worst time to discover it.

If your credentials are not at the default path, link the default at the real file
once, here, rather than exporting `ENV_FILE` from whatever shell happens to invoke
the script:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/your/.env .env
```

A symlink survives every session, every restart, and every agent that forgets.
An exported variable survives none of them. The target file keeps its own `600`.

Prove it resolved before you rely on it; this sends nothing:

```bash
echo hi > /tmp/b.txt
scripts/send.sh --check "$(grep -m1 -v '^[[:space:]]*#' roster.md | sed 's/.*|//' | tr -d '[:blank:]')" "check" /tmp/b.txt
```

A `From:` line carrying your agent's address means it found them. `no sender
address in ...` means it did not.

### 3.1 If the listener exits complaining about the old schema

An earlier version of the workspace `.env` named three keys after servers and
stored **ports** in them (`AGENT_EMAIL_INCOMING_SERVER_IMAP=993`) and used
`AGENT_EMAIL_HOST` for the mail *domain* rather than the server.

The listener refuses to start on that, by design, and tells you which key to
split. Read literally those names send you to the wrong host, and often to one the
mail server's TLS certificate does not cover, which surfaces as an endless
reconnect loop rather than an error, because a certificate failure arrives as a
network error. Split them into `_HOST` and `_PORT` and it will start.

**Parse it, do not source it.** `. .env` breaks on any value
containing shell metacharacters, and passwords routinely have them. Read it as
`KEY=VALUE` data, which is what `idle_listener.py` and `preflight.py` both do.

**A mixed file is fine.** Resolution is per field, not per schema, so a `.env`
holding host and ports as `AGENTEIAMAIL_*` and account and password as
`AGENT_EMAIL_*` works without any tidying. Each field independently prefers the
`AGENTEIAMAIL_*` name and falls back to the other. You do not need to make it
consistent before it will run.

Check the file's mode while you are there: `stat -c '%a %n' <path>`. If it is not
`600`, say so to your human rather than fixing it silently; a credential file that
was world-readable may already have been read.

---

## 4. Himalaya

Reading and sending are Himalaya's job. The listener never fetches bodies.

### 4.1 Check what is already there, first

```bash
command -v himalaya && himalaya --version
ls -l ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml 2>/dev/null && grep -n '^\[accounts\.' ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml
himalaya account list 2>/dev/null
```

| What you find | What to do |
|---|---|
| Not installed | Install, then write a fresh config |
| Installed, no config | Write a fresh config |
| **Installed with accounts** | **Back up, then append only** |

For the third case, the common one:

```bash
cp ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml ~/.config/himalaya/config.toml.bak.$(date +%F)
```

Then append an `[accounts.agenteiamail]` block. **Do not set `default = true`** if
another account holds it; you would silently repoint every bare `himalaya` command
at this mailbox. **Pass `-a agenteiamail` on every command**, without exception,
even when it feels redundant.

Confirm you broke nothing:

```bash
himalaya account list     # every pre-existing account must still be there
```

### 4.2 Install, only if missing

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimalaya/himalaya/master/install.sh | PREFIX=~/.local sh
```

Prefer this user-local binary over the system package, which may lag the version
whose config schema you are writing against.

### 4.3 Configure

**Check your version first: the schema is completely different across majors.**

```bash
himalaya --version
```

There is no `himalaya account configure` in v2; the wizard is bare `himalaya`.
Both schemas below were verified against a running binary, not read from docs.

### v2.x

Backends are named sections, the host and port are one URL, and TLS is implied by
the scheme. Auth is SASL.

Himalaya's own config lives outside the clone and is read by Himalaya, not by
anything here, so the credentials path in it has to be written out in full.
Substitute the real path of the file `agenteiamail_env_file` reported in step 2 —
which on a harness install is that harness's workspace `.env`, not a path inside
the clone. Himalaya resolves nothing for you: a placeholder left in place fails
as an auth error.

```toml
[accounts.agenteiamail]
email = "agent@example.com"
default = true
mailbox.alias.inbox = "INBOX"

[accounts.agenteiamail.imap]
server = "imaps://mail.example.com:993"
[accounts.agenteiamail.imap.sasl.plain]
authcid = "agent@example.com"
password.cmd = "sed -n 's/^AGENTEIAMAIL_PASSWORD=//p' /full/path/to/the/.env"

[accounts.agenteiamail.smtp]
server = "smtps://mail.example.com:465"
[accounts.agenteiamail.smtp.sasl.plain]
authcid = "agent@example.com"
password.cmd = "sed -n 's/^AGENTEIAMAIL_PASSWORD=//p' /full/path/to/the/.env"
```

`mailbox.alias.inbox` is not optional on v2. Without it the account is valid and
`himalaya account check` passes, while every `envelope list` fails — verified on
v2.1.0 by @ateneabuffayhermes during the first Hermes Agent install. It must
appear before the first `[accounts.agenteiamail.*]` sub-table, or TOML attaches
it to the wrong table.

Confirm both backends registered; an empty `BACKENDS` column means the config
parsed but nothing is wired, which then fails later with
`No backend matching 'auto' is configured`:

```bash
himalaya account list        # BACKENDS must read "imap, smtp"
himalaya account check -a agenteiamail
```

**`account check` passing is not the proof.** It authenticates; it does not read
a mailbox. Section 4.4 below is the check that can fail after this one
succeeds.

### v1.x

Flat `backend` keys, separate host and port, explicit encryption. **The secret key
is `auth.cmd`, not `auth.command`**: `command` is silently ignored.

```toml
[accounts.agenteiamail]
email = "agent@example.com"
backend = "imap"
imap-host = "mail.example.com"
imap-port = 993
imap-ssl = true
imap-login = "agent@example.com"
imap-auth = "passwd"
imap-passwd.cmd = "sed -n 's/^AGENTEIAMAIL_PASSWORD=//p' /full/path/to/the/.env"
```

Field names moved between 1.x releases too, so if a key is rejected, the error
names the ones it expected; that is the fastest way to the right shape.

**Use a command-based secret in either version, not the keyring.** On a headless
box there is no unlocked keyring, and a systemd service failing to reach
`secret-service` looks exactly like an auth error. A `600` file read by a command
works everywhere and survives reboot.

### 4.4 Prove it

```bash
himalaya envelope list -a agenteiamail -s 5
```

Do not continue until that returns real output.

---

## 5. Run the listener as a service

**Templates are in [`systemd/`](systemd/).** Copy them and replace the two
placeholders: `REPO` with the absolute path to your clone, `ENVFILE` with your
credentials file. systemd does not expand `~`, so use `%h` or a full path.

```bash
install -Dm644 systemd/agenteiamail-idle.service       ~/.config/systemd/user/
install -Dm644 systemd/agenteiamail-dispatch.service   ~/.config/systemd/user/
install -Dm644 systemd/agenteiamail-logrotate.service  ~/.config/systemd/user/
install -Dm644 systemd/agenteiamail-logrotate.timer    ~/.config/systemd/user/

# then replace the placeholders in the three .service files:
#   /path/to/agenteiamail  ->  your clone's absolute path
#   /path/to/env           ->  your credentials file (idle only)

# and confirm systemd is happy before enabling anything:
systemd-analyze verify ~/.config/systemd/user/agenteiamail-*.{service,timer}
```

That last command prints nothing and exits 0 when the units are sound. **Read the
exit code, not the absence of alarm**: it is easy to run it, see no obvious
complaint, and move on while it was in fact objecting.

They were added after a clean-room reinstall showed that composing them from the
prose below took real work and got no help from the repository. The prose stays,
because it is what the templates are for:

- `Restart=always`, `RestartSec=10`
- `StandardOutput=append:` the event log, `StandardError=append:` the error log,
  **they must be separate files** (see DESIGN.md)
- `--env` on `ExecStart` if your credentials are not at the default path
- `--roster` on `ExecStart` if `roster.md` is not at the repository root. The
  listener reads it to tag mail from approved senders, and an install pointing at
  the wrong file tags nobody, and the agent then reports mail it should be acting on

```bash
mkdir -p state
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now agenteiamail-idle.service
systemctl --user enable --now agenteiamail-dispatch.service
systemctl --user enable --now agenteiamail-logrotate.timer
```

**Then enable lingering**, or the service dies when your human logs out:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

This is the step everyone forgets, and its failure mode is the listener quietly
disappearing at the end of a session.

Set up rotation too: `harness/rotate_logs.py` driven by a user timer. It uses
`copytruncate`, which is required rather than stylistic; DESIGN.md says why.

---

## 6. Harness wiring

`harness/dispatch.py` and `harness/session_start.py` are in this repo and working.

**One command answers whether this install works**, once §7 has been through
once by hand:

```bash
scripts/healthcheck.py          # nonzero when mail cannot be detected or delivered
scripts/healthcheck.py --json   # the same facts, for a script
```

It reports the selected runtime and whether it can be reached, both services,
the listener's position, the queue depth and the age of the oldest thing in it,
where the credentials are and what mode they carry, and the installed version.
It says explicitly that reaching a runtime is not proof a delivered event lands
in front of anybody, because "health: ok" is the phrase people stop reading
after.

**Where to put the clone.** The clone *is* the install: credentials, generated
config, route secrets, the roster and the whole state tree live inside it, so
choosing where to clone is how you choose where to install.

| Runtime | Clone at |
| --- | --- |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/workspace/agenteiamail` |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/workspace/agenteiamail` |

Nothing requires those paths — every path this tool generates is resolved from
where the scripts actually are, so a clone anywhere works and an existing one
needs no move. They are the recommended locations, not a check.

```
<clone>/
  .env              mailbox credentials, 0600
  runtime.env       generated, installer-owned
  install.manifest  what the installer may remove
  roster.md        who this agent may write to unattended
  hermes/           the two route secrets, 0600
  state/            UID baseline, journal, cursor, delivery status, logs
```

Only the four unit files live outside it, in `~/.config/systemd/user`, because
systemd will not read them from anywhere else.

**This puts secrets inside a git working tree.** `.gitignore` keeps them out of
`git status`, `scripts/install.sh` refuses to write if any of them is tracked or
unignored, and `scripts/test_paths.sh` asserts the rules in CI. What none of that
prevents is **`git clean -xdf`, which deletes ignored files** — here that means
the mailbox password, both route secrets, the roster and the UID baseline, in one
command. On a live install, use `git clean -df`.

**Where the credentials go.** `.env` at the top of the clone. An install that
already keeps them elsewhere keeps them there: an existing file, or the symlink
older OpenClaw installs left behind, is used where it lies. Credentials are never
copied to a second location to satisfy a convention, and nothing is ever written
into a harness's own `.env`.

**An install made before this layout keeps its own**, entirely — credentials
under `~/.config/agenteiamail`, state under `~/.local/state/agenteiamail`. That
is a supported state, not a bug, and an upgrade will not move it. See
[`UPGRADE.md`](UPGRADE.md) for `scripts/install.sh --migrate`, which moves it
only when you ask.

The rule is in [`harness/paths.py`](harness/paths.py), with the shell half in
[`scripts/envpath.sh`](scripts/envpath.sh), and
[`scripts/test_paths.sh`](scripts/test_paths.sh) asserts the two agree with the
setup form's PHP.

**`harness/dispatch.py` is what the systemd unit runs.** It reads the event
journal the listener writes, hands each record to a runtime adapter, and moves the
cursor only once that adapter reports the runtime accepted it. A template is in
[`systemd/agenteiamail-dispatch.service`](systemd/agenteiamail-dispatch.service).

**Choose the runtime with `AGENTEIAMAIL_RUNTIME`** in that unit: `openclaw`,
`hermes`, or `auto`. `auto` picks only when exactly one supported runtime is
present on the host, and refuses rather than guessing when none or several are.
Set it explicitly if this machine runs more than one harness.

For Hermes, configure the two authenticated routes, health URL, secret files,
and trust boundary in [`HERMES.md`](HERMES.md). The included static route
example is operator-reviewed configuration, not something the installer grants
to itself. A successful `GET /health` proves reachability only; complete the two
signed route and user-facing checks before declaring the install ready.

**Run exactly one dispatcher.** It is the only consumer of the journal and the
only writer of the cursor. A session must never start a second one: two consumers
deliver the same message twice and race on one cursor file. `session_start.py`
reports what is still queued and stops there.

**OpenClaw has no facility for consuming a script's stdout as an event stream**,
there is no `--stream-command` in its cron. Do not go looking for one; that search
has already been done and it is a dead end.

The working pattern is the inverse: the OpenClaw adapter **pushes** into the
session with `openclaw system event --mode now`. It is an active producer, not a
passive stream.

The one piece that may need adapting to your harness version is the output payload
of `session_start.py`; it is marked in the file.

### Claude Code

This runtime is wired differently from the other two, and the difference is not
cosmetic. **Nothing outside a Claude Code session can speak into it** — there is
no `claude system event`, and `claude -p --resume` starts a fresh headless turn
rather than appearing in the session you are sitting in. So the dispatcher writes
each rendered line to `state/session.spool` and stops there, and the session
comes and gets it. `DESIGN.md`, *"Why one runtime pulls"*, is the full account.

Two consequences for the install:

**No `claude` binary is required.** Delivery is a file append. The binary is used
only by the opt-in agent mode below, so the installer does not demand it and a
host without it on `PATH` is fine.

**The session-start hook has to be registered in Claude Code's own settings**,
and that file is yours rather than this project's. It holds configuration this
repository knows nothing about, so the installer never converges it and never
records it in the ownership manifest. Register it explicitly:

```bash
scripts/claude_hook.py --print     # show the fragment, change nothing
scripts/claude_hook.py --install   # merge it in, backing up first
scripts/claude_hook.py --check     # exits 0 when registered
```

`--install` **appends** to any `SessionStart` list already there rather than
replacing it, because Claude Code runs every hook registered for the event and
replacing the list would silently disable whatever your host already does at
startup. Running it twice does not duplicate the entry. If the file is not valid
JSON it refuses and changes nothing, rather than rewriting a file it could not
read.

**What the hook then asks of the agent.** At each session start it replays what
arrived while nothing was watching and prints the exact watch command, including
a byte offset:

```
bash <clone>/harness/session_watch.sh <state_dir> <offset>
```

The agent must arm that as a persistent Monitor. The offset is not optional:
the hook replayed the spool through exactly that byte, so starting anywhere else
repeats messages or steps over ones nobody has seen. **Arming is also what
acknowledges the replay** — an agent that skips it sees the same messages again
next session and receives no new mail for the rest of this one.

`session_watch.sh` takes an exclusive lock, so a second session on the same host
refuses to arm rather than racing the first on the offset file. One session per
host is the supported arrangement.

**Optional: let mail reach an agent with no session open.** Setting
`AGENTEIAMAIL_CLAUDE_MODE=agent` in `runtime.env` starts a headless `claude -p`
run per event. It is **off by default**, because it widens what an inbound
message can cause — read the roster rules in `AGENTS.md` before turning it on.
The spool write happens either way, so enabling or disabling it can never lose
an event.

**Verifying it.** `scripts/healthcheck.py` reports how many spool bytes no
session has picked up yet. Read that as information, not as a fault: unread bytes
with no session open is this runtime's normal resting state. Whether a session
has armed a watch is not observable from outside one, and the healthcheck says so
rather than guessing.

**Check the dispatcher can actually reach `openclaw`.** A systemd user service gets a
minimal PATH with nothing under `$HOME`, so a binary installed by npm is often
invisible to it even though your shell finds it. The adapter looks in the usual
per-user locations and **says so on its own stderr if it finds nothing**.

**Finding it is not enough: it has to be able to run.** `openclaw` is a Node
program, and the service PATH decides which `node` it gets. That is often not the
one your shell uses. An `openclaw` that needs a newer Node than the service hands
it is **present, executable, and fails on every call**, which looks nothing like a
missing binary and everything like a quiet mailbox.

Check the version the *service* would see, not the one you see:

```bash
systemd-run --user --pipe --quiet /usr/bin/env node --version
```

Compare it against what your OpenClaw build requires; `openclaw --version` in your
own shell will fail loudly if the Node it finds is too old. One observed install
needed Node 24 and the service supplied 22.

If they differ, set both where the fix survives an upgrade — in
`~/.config/environment.d/`, not in the unit:

```ini
# ~/.config/environment.d/10-openclaw-user-path.conf
OPENCLAW=/home/you/.npm-global/bin/openclaw
PATH=/home/you/.nvm/versions/node/v24.4.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

**That file is read when the user manager starts**, so it governs every later
login and does nothing for the session already running. Apply it to the live
manager too, then restart the service:

```bash
systemctl --user set-environment OPENCLAW=/home/you/.npm-global/bin/openclaw
systemctl --user set-environment PATH=/home/you/.nvm/versions/node/v24.4.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
systemctl --user restart agenteiamail-dispatch.service
```

**Do not pin these by editing the installed unit.** `scripts/install.sh`
converges all four units from the copies in `systemd/`, so an `Environment=` line
added by hand is drift and `--upgrade` removes it. The install keeps working
until the next upgrade and then stops — dispatcher unable to reach `openclaw`
again, every check in §7 still passing, and the only evidence in
`state/watch.err.log`. That is this section's own failure mode, arriving later by
a route nobody thinks to suspect.

If you would rather carry it in the unit anyway, uncomment the `Environment=`
line in `systemd/agenteiamail-dispatch.service` **in the clone** and rerun the
installer. Convergence copies from there, so that edit is the source rather than
drift, and it survives.

**These warnings cannot reach your session, and you have to go and look for them.**
If `openclaw` is missing or cannot run, the watcher has no way to inject anything,
including a warning about `openclaw`. It lands in the watcher's error log, or the
journal if the unit has no `StandardError=`, and nowhere else.

So check it explicitly after enabling the watcher:

```bash
grep -iE "openclaw not found|injection failed" state/watch.err.log
journalctl --user -u agenteiamail-dispatch.service | grep -iE "openclaw not found|injection failed"
```

Both silent means it resolved. Without this the watcher runs, the log fills, every
other check in §7 passes, and no notification is ever delivered.

## 7. Verification

Do not report success until every line passes.

```bash
# 0. Which version you just installed, and whether it is the current one.
#    Exit 2 means a newer release exists; exit 1 means the check could not
#    reach the remote, which is not the same as being up to date.
scripts/version.sh

# 1. Running, and for more than a moment
systemctl --user is-active agenteiamail-idle.service
systemctl --user show agenteiamail-idle.service -p ActiveEnterTimestamp

# 2. Healthy start: expect "listening on INBOX, baseline uid N"
tail -3 state/idle.err.log

# 3. Lingering on
loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger

# 4. Himalaya reads
himalaya envelope list -a agenteiamail -s 3

# 4b. The watcher found openclaw: silence here is the pass
grep -i "openclaw not found" state/watch.err.log 2>/dev/null \
  || journalctl --user -u agenteiamail-dispatch.service 2>/dev/null | grep -i "openclaw not found" \
  || echo "watcher: openclaw resolved"

# 5. End to end: have someone external send you mail
tail -f state/mail.log       # a line within ~2s

# 6. Sending behaves: who it will write to, and what Himalaya is handed.
#    Includes substring/prefix attacks on the allowlist and the From: header
#    Himalaya v2 requires.
scripts/test_roster.sh

# 6a. And on receive: the same list, as the listener reads it
python3 scripts/test_listener.py

# 6b. Against your real roster: a stranger is refused with exit 2
echo hi > /tmp/b.txt; ./scripts/send.sh nobody@nowhere.invalid "test" /tmp/b.txt; echo "exit=$?"

# 6c. send.sh can find its credentials (sends nothing)
scripts/send.sh --check jjulianfe@gmail.com "check" /tmp/b.txt | head -6

# 6d. Your own mail is tagged. Send yourself one, then:
grep ", roster]" state/mail.log | tail -1
# No output means the agent will not act on your mail. Check that the address in
# roster.md matches the From address your mail actually arrives with.

# 7. Survives restart without replaying or losing anything
systemctl --user restart agenteiamail-idle.service
tail -2 state/idle.err.log  # expect "resuming from uid N"
```

**A restart can take up to 30 seconds.** The listener is usually blocked waiting
on the IMAP socket, and it only notices the stop signal when that wait ends. It is
finishing, not hanging; `systemctl` returns when it is done.

**Test 7 is the one that matters.** *"resuming from uid N"* rather than *"baseline
uid N"* proves state persistence. If it says baseline after a restart, the state
file is not being written, and the next reboot will silently swallow every message
that arrived while the machine was off.

**Worth asking your external sender for more than one message.** A plain one, one
with accented characters in the subject, and one shaped like a GitHub notification
(`[owner/repo] Title (Issue #9)`). Those exercise header decoding and the subject
parser, which is where the bugs found on 2026-08-09 were hiding, both of them
invisible to a single ASCII test.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Notifications arrive in batches, minutes late | A pipe stage is buffering. `grep` needs `--line-buffered`, `sed` needs `-u`. `head` cannot flush at all, so never put it in this pipe. |
| Everything stops after a week, log looks fine | Rotation ran and a tail used `-f`. Use `-F`, which re-opens by name. |
| Listener vanishes when your human logs out | `loginctl enable-linger` was never run. |
| `login rejected` but the password is right | Himalaya reaching for a keyring that does not exist under systemd. Use the command-based secret. Also check for a trailing `\r` if the env file was ever edited on Windows. |
| Connects, retries forever, no clear error | Certificate hostname mismatch. The listener treats it as a network error and backs off rather than failing loudly. See §1.2. |
| Silence, and you assume no mail | You are not watching the error log. A dead listener looks exactly like a quiet mailbox. |
| Every message replays on restart | State file not writable. Check `state/`. |
| Hundreds replay once, then normal | `UIDVALIDITY` changed: the mailbox was recreated. Working as designed. |
| Subject shows `=?utf-8?q?...?=` | Header decoding broken. Fixed in this repo; if you see it, you are on an old commit. |
