  agenteiamail — mailbox setup
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Send this link to whoever is setting up the mailbox:

      $url

  If they are not sitting at this machine, they run this first,
  on their own computer, and then open the same link there:

      ssh -L $PORT:127.0.0.1:$PORT $(id -un)@$(hostname -f 2>/dev/null || hostname)

  The link works once, until this stops. Ctrl-C when finished.
  Server log: $LOG
