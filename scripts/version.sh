#   version.sh --installed  the installed version alone, for scripting
#   version.sh --line       one cached line, for the session-start hook

# 1 is the case worth designing for. "You are on the latest" and "I could not

# to avoid — an agent believing it is current because nothing said otherwise.
#
# The installed version comes from the VERSION file rather than `git describe`,
# because the file survives what the tag does not: a tarball copy, a shallow
# clone, a detached HEAD, a clone whose tags were never fetched. All four report
# an install correctly; `git describe` reports three of them as unknown.
#
# The released version comes from `git ls-remote` against this clone's own
# origin, not the GitHub API: no token to hold, no rate limit to hit, and it
# works against a fork or a mirror without being told about it.

No readable VERSION file at $VERSION_FILE.

Every release from 1.2.0 onward ships one. A clone without it is either older

Reading the released version from the remote failed. Not "there is no newer
release": no answer at all. Do not report this as up to date.

  git -C $REPO ls-remote --tags --refs origin 'v*'

Run that to see why. Usual causes: no network from this host, a remote that has
been renamed or made private, or a clone with no origin.

Read every CHANGELOG.md entry between them before pulling. Releases carry an
"Upgrade actions" section when a pull alone is not enough, and the change that
has broken an install once already was a file moving to a path the systemd unit
still named.

Then follow UPGRADE.md, which is that sequence in order:
