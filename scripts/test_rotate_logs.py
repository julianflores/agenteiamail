"""
The log rotator writes where the rest of the install reads.

This exists because of a specific silent failure. `rotate_logs.py` used to hard
-code `~/.local/state/agenteiamail` and was the only consumer with no way to
redirect it. Once the units started writing somewhere else, `main()` recreated
that directory empty, globbed no logs, printed nothing and returned 0 — so the
weekly timer reported success forever while the real logs grew without bound,
and the recreated directory made a finished migration look half-done.

Both halves are asserted here. The second one — that the old path is never
created — is the one that fails when the resolver is bypassed, and it is the
half a test written from the happy path would leave out.
