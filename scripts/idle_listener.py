"""
idle_listener.py — push-style new-mail listener for the agenteiamail mailbox.

Holds an IMAP IDLE connection open. The server pushes an untagged EXISTS as soon
as mail arrives; we fetch headers for the new UIDs and print one line per message
on stdout.

Every message is reported, whoever sent it. Messages from an address on
`roster.txt` are additionally tagged `roster` in the emitted line: that tag is
how the agent knows, without opening anything, that this is mail it may act on
and answer. Everything else is a notification and nothing more.

One stdout line == one harness notification. Output is line-buffered and never
contains credentials.

Usage:  python3 scripts/idle_listener.py [--env PATH] [--mailbox INBOX] [--once] [--roster PATH]
Exit:   0 clean shutdown · 1 configuration or login failure (not retryable)
