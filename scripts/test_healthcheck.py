What the health command refuses to call healthy.

The point of this check is the failure where nothing looks wrong: a listener
that died, a runtime nobody can reach, a queue nothing is draining. Each of
those leaves an empty inbox and a calm log, so every assertion below is about
whether the command says something is wrong when nothing is obviously wrong.

# openclaw.detect() looks for a binary on the host and is true in any process,
# while hermes.detect() reads five HERMES_* variables out of the environment and
# was false in every process but the units. So the documented command reported
# no runtime on a Hermes install that was delivering mail, and only on Hermes —
# which is why it survived to 1.7.0 unnoticed.
