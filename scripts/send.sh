# --cc is held to the same rule -- it is a second address this agent writes to,
# not a lesser one, so it is checked against the roster exactly like <to>.

# --check prints the message it would send and sends nothing. Use it to prove
# this script can find its credentials, which the roster tests cannot: the roster
# gate runs first, so a refusal exits before the env file is ever read.

#   ROSTER    path to the allowlist        (default: repo root/roster.md)
#   ENV_FILE  path to the credentials file (default: from envpath.sh)
#
# ENV_FILE matters on any host whose credentials live somewhere else — the
# OpenClaw workspace `.env`, say. The listener is told with `--env` on its unit;
# this script has no unit to carry the flag, so point the default at the real
# file once, at install time. INSTALL.md §3 says how.

# machinery, because every ordinary client sends the rest of these.

# Found end to end on a live v2 host (#23). Do not trim this list back to the
# ones that look required — the message that failed was the short one.

# Header values are ASCII by RFC 5322. Raw UTF-8 rides on an extension the
# receiving server has to advertise, and where it is merely tolerated it still
# reads as a spam signal — which is the failure this whole block exists to avoid.
# Nearly every subject this agent sends has an accent in it, so this path is the
# common one, not the edge case.
#
# One encoded-word, not the folded sequence RFC 2047 asks for above 75 characters.

# --- What was sent, written down where it survives the process -----------------
#
# Until #117 this script's only record of a send was the line below, on stdout,
# which dies with the shell that ran it. Inbound, this project journals every
# message twice over so nothing can be lost silently; outbound it kept nothing,
# and the first agent asked whether it had sent something searched its whole
# mailbox and could not tell. An empty Sent folder and a message that never left
# look identical.
#
# Himalaya does not save a copy unless asked -- `--save <MAILBOX>` is opt-in, and
# sending is SMTP, which has no Sent folder at all; a copy there is a separate
# IMAP APPEND. So this is the only record that exists by default, and it is ours
# rather than the mail server's: readable with no network, and still true if the
# account is later lost.
#
# Deliberately not the body. The question a roster raises is who and when, and a
# log of message bodies is a mail password's worth of liability in a different
# shape. cc is part of "who" -- omitting it here would leave the audit this log
# exists for blind to half of what --cc was built to do.
#
# Written after the send, never before, so nothing here can claim a delivery that
# did not happen. A failure to write is reported and does not fail the command:
# the mail has already gone, and exiting nonzero would report a failed send for
# one that succeeded -- which is the mistake this whole change exists to stop
# people making in the other direction.
