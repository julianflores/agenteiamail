"""
Whether this install can currently detect mail and deliver it.

Not "is anything wrong right now", which a quiet mailbox answers the same way as
a dead listener. Every check here asks about a mechanism rather than about
traffic, because the failure this project exists to prevent is precisely the one
where everything looks calm and nothing is being seen.

Exits nonzero when mail cannot be detected or cannot be delivered. A backlog
waiting on a runtime that is down is a failure; a backlog moving through a
runtime that is up is not.

    Layer the installer's `runtime.env` under the real environment.

    The services are handed this file by systemd (`EnvironmentFile=` in
    agenteiamail-dispatch.service). A hand-run healthcheck is handed it by
    nothing at all, and that is a real difference rather than a cosmetic one:
    `adapters/hermes.py` detects its runtime by reading five `HERMES_*`
    variables out of the environment, while `adapters/openclaw.py` detects its
    own by looking for a binary on the host. So this command has always worked
    when run by hand on OpenClaw and could not work on Hermes, where it reported
    no selected runtime on an install whose services were delivering mail.

    Read as data, never sourced. This is the inverse of the
    `generated-runtime-config` branch of `render_artifact()` in
    scripts/install.sh, including the backslash escaping that writes it; change
    both or neither. `runtime.env` holds no secrets — the two Hermes route
    secrets are named by path and never by value — and nothing here prints what
    it read either way.

    The real environment wins, so `AGENTEIAMAIL_RUNTIME=... scripts/healthcheck.py`
    still overrides the file. Returns the path read, or None when there was
    nothing to read: a manual install, or an OpenClaw host, has no such file and
    that is not a fault.
