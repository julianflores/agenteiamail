# Cross-checks scripts/roster_extract.sh (send.sh's own address extraction)
# against scripts/roster.py's roster_addresses() on a set of fixture rosters.
#
# #91 happened because send.sh and roster.py each implemented "find the field
# containing @" independently, and nothing asserted they agreed -- roster.py
# was fixed for the table format and send.sh was not, so the drift shipped in
# a tagged release. This is that assertion. #98.
#
# Two implementations that both silently return nothing "agree" with each
# other while catching nothing. #90 fixed test_paths.sh for exactly this: a
# cross-check that cannot tell "agreed" from "neither ran" reports 0 failed
# either way. So every fixture also pins a specific address that must appear
# on both sides independently, not just that the two sides match each other.
