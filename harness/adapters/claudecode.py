"""
The Claude Code adapter: deliver an event by appending it to the session spool.

This runtime is different from the other two in one way that shapes everything
here. **Nothing outside a Claude Code session can speak into it.** There is no
`claude system event`; `claude -p --resume` starts a fresh headless turn and
never appears on the screen of the session a human is sitting in front of.

So delivery inverts. OpenClaw and Hermes are pushed to; Claude Code comes and
gets it. This adapter's whole job is to put the rendered line somewhere two
session-side readers can find it:

- the `SessionStart` hook, which replays what arrived while nothing was running;
- an armed `Monitor`, which reports each new line as it lands.

Both read by byte offset, which is what makes the two of them safe together: the
hook replays through byte N and asks for the monitor to be armed *at* N, so
nothing falls in the gap and nothing is shown twice.

**Why the spool is not named `*.log`.** `rotate_logs.py` rotates every `*.log` in
the state directory, and rotation renumbers bytes. Both readers index into this
file by offset, so a rotation between a hook replay and a monitor arming would
silently resume at the wrong place — showing mail twice, or stepping over mail
that was never shown. A skipped message and a quiet mailbox are indistinguishable
from the outside, which is the failure this project exists to prevent. The `.spool`
extension keeps it out of that glob deliberately; do not rename it to `.log`.

The file therefore grows without bound. That is a real cost, accepted for now
because it grows by one line per message, and preferable to a rotation scheme
that would have to move two independent readers' cursors atomically.
