"""
The canonical event envelope, and the append-only journal that holds it.

This is the seam between the half that knows about mail and the half that knows
about a harness. The listener writes envelopes; a runtime adapter reads them and
delivers them. Neither has to know anything about the other, which is the whole
reason this file exists: before it, delivering to a second harness meant parsing
a human-readable log line written for a person to read.

Two properties the rest of the design leans on:

**A record is only ever read once it is whole.** Records are appended as one
write each and consumed only up to the last newline, so a reader can never see
half of one. Without that the cursor could stop inside a record and the next read
would start mid-JSON.

**The cursor is a byte offset of a record boundary.** It advances only past
records a runtime has accepted, so the answer to "what has been delivered" is one
number on disk that survives a restart.
