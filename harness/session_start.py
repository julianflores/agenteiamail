"""
Session-start hook — make a new session aware of mail it would otherwise miss.

The listener notices mail within about a second and appends to mail.log. But a
systemd service cannot push into an agent session; only a live event source can.
So each session does two things: show what the watcher has not yet delivered, and
say which version is installed, since a session start is the only moment an agent
can be told either of them unprompted.

It does not start a watcher. The supervised service is the single consumer of the
log, and the sole writer of the cursor. A session that armed its own copy made two
consumers of one stream racing on one cursor file, which duplicated events and
corrupted the record of what had been seen.

Never fails the session: any unexpected error degrades to a quiet no-op, because a
broken hook must not be able to block startup.
